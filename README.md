### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Julius Seporaitis. At the moment I hover between being head of engineering and being senior software engineer. My areas of professional interest are - DevOps / Infrastructure / Developer Tools / Developer Productivity / Backend. I recently started documenting my ideas and experience in a blog. Some of my popular posts:
